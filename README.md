# cs373project3

This is a Facility Management System project for our Comp 373/473 Class. It's purpose is to instantiate the created objects using the Spring Framework to create the dependencies at runtime. In the most recent updates, this repo also uses bridge and observer patterns.

The project has 3 main structures: the data acess layer, the model layer, and the view layer.
The UML diagram shows the interactions between the three different layers as well as the interactions between the separate classes within the layers.

In order to test the program it would be easier to compile and run "FacilityClient.java" in the cs373p1/src/src/View/ folder. This will run through all the classes in the model layer as well as instantiate interactions with the data access layer.

In the cs373p1/src/tests/ folder there are two classes "FacilityTest.java" and "MaintenanceTest.java" which will test the objects of the respective sections of the project.
